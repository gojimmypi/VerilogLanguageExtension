These directories are NOT part of the Verilog Language Extension development solution and should be zipped up (via the Export Template...) and included in the .\ProjectTemplates directory for distribution with installation file.

If these projects are added to the main solution, a large number of (probably undesired) build configurations for the FPGA board will be added to that solution.

Instead, when editing these project templates, open the respective solution file (e.g. [AddedExtensionProjectTEmplate/Verilog Project/Verilog Project.sln](./Verilog Project/Verilog Project.sln) )

See also the [Verilog Project/README.md](./Verilog Project/README.md) file.
