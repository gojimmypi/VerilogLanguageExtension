# Lattice Semiconductor

Discussion on improving relationship with open source community. The technical landscape is changing.
More people want open source solutions for long term support and improved security visibility. 

Who is @gojimmypi? I'm here as a maker and a hobbyist. I'm not affiliated with Lattice, or any other chip maker.
I have a Bachelor's Degreee in Electronic Engineering from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo - and over 30 years of experience
in tecnhology: 9 years at a biotech company developing custom chemical manufacturing and monitoring solutions; another 7 years at a software company as a senior application developer (and occasional network admin), and now as a senior software engineer at a health organzation, where for the last 15 years I've been developing business process automation and business intelligence solutions.

My passion is and always has been electronics. I'm here to try and improve the relationship between the open source community and Lattice Semiconductor.

## Objective

There's just a 30 minute slot for discussion. If well presented there could be future opportunities.

I'd like to ensure the proper message is well conveyed.

## Thank You

Lattice did a quite impressive job of quickly recovering from potentially disastrous PR 
in [their response](https://twitter.com/latticesemi/status/1269115302140231682?s=20) 
to Dave's [outburst](https://twitter.com/fpga_dave/status/1268497428501725184?s=20) over the
change in licensing terms.

Also a personal thank you from @gojimmypi for Lattice not only kindly replying to web form inquiry,
but then also being responsive to subsequent email exchange and arranging this conference call.

## Improved Communication

Lattice hardly ever "likes" or retweets any of the awesome projects using their hardware. Why?

There's a greast opportunity for Lattice to simply show appreciation for all the great projects that showcase their
hardware.

## Documentation

Why not provide bitstream documentation for low-end products like ICE40 and ECP5?
It seems like a waste of talent to let extraordinarily talented engineers reverse engineer things.
Why not just give out the docs and let those engineers spend their time on improving the open source tools?

## Technical Cooperation

Partial reconfiguration - for example: build a riscv processor and load it in, 
Then change a peripheral and not re-place and route the whole design  (thanks @matthewvenn)

Claire: "They essentially told us they won't be in our way but they also see no commercial relevance to what we are doing."

## Direct Financial Support

Clair Wolf @oe1cxw is setting up a non-profit. Patreons. Grants for specific projects. Contests and awards.

## Free

Many things can be done at practically zero financial cost, but with tremendous indirect value and show of good will.

## Benefits

This is what it as all about, right? What is the benefit to Lattice Semiconductor?

Education and reach. Why not have Lattice chips be the defacto standard in all univeristy and other educational environments? Why let some other company step into this role? Schools don't want expensive, proprietary tools.

If there's a comfort zone for students with a particular technology, of course they will likely stick with that technology.
