# Lattice Semiconductor Dialog

Discussion on improving relationship with open source community. The technical landscape is changing.
More people want open source solutions for long term support and improved security visibility. 

Who is @gojimmypi? I'm here as a maker and a hobbyist. I'm not affiliated with Lattice, or any other chip maker.

My passion is and always has been electronics. I'm here to try and improve the relationship between the open source community and Lattice Semiconductor.

Hopefully these free and honest suggestions, with no risk to me regarding company politics or history... can make a difference. 

## Objective

There's just a 30 minute slot for discussion. If well presented there could be future opportunities for continued dialog.

I'd like to ensure the proper message is well conveyed. I've invited input from several people. (thank you all for the feedback)

## Thank You

Lattice did a quite impressive job of quickly recovering from potentially disastrous PR 
in [their response](https://twitter.com/latticesemi/status/1269115302140231682?s=20) 
to Dave's [outburst](https://twitter.com/fpga_dave/status/1268497428501725184?s=20) over the
change in licensing terms. It seems the entire community expressed their relief and thanks to the response.

Also a personal thank you from @gojimmypi for Lattice not only kindly replying to web form inquiry,
but then also being responsive to subsequent email exchange and arranging this conference call.

## Improved Communication

Lattice Semiconductor is conspicuously missing from the tech community.

Olof Kindgren:
>The story about their licensing and their reversal got _far_ more attention on both LinkedIn and Twitter 
>than any of their recent product announcements. That could be an indication that this is much larger than they think

Lattice hardly ever "likes" or retweets any of the awesome projects using their hardware. Why?

There's a great opportunity for Lattice to simply show appreciation for all the great projects that showcase their
hardware. 

## Documentation

Why not provide bitstream documentation for low-end products like ICE40 and ECP5?
It seems like a waste of talent to allow extraordinarily talented engineers reverse engineer things.
Why not just give out the docs and let those engineers spend their time on improving the open source tools?

## Technical Cooperation

Partial reconfiguration - for example: build a riscv processor and load it in, 
Then change a peripheral and not re-place and route the whole design.

Claire: 
>They essentially told us they won't be in our way but they also see no commercial relevance to what we are doing.

## Direct Financial Support

Claire Wolf @oe1cxw is setting up a non-profit. Patreons. Grants for specific projects. Contests and awards.

## Lower Cost

The official Lattice evaluation boards are unreasonably expensive. In a way, that's great for the open source community in being
able to provide much lower cost boards. For instance: the [HM01B0 UPduino Shield](https://www.latticesemi.com/products/developmentboardsandkits/himaxhm01b0)
First, name leaves quite a bit to be desired. The cost: $115? Ouch. With a lead time of 31 weeks? Double ouch.

I personally would never buy that board at that cost. There could be a "limit 1" purchase, at say $25. It's ok to sell these
at a loss. That's the whole point of _evaluation_ board, no?

## Free

Many things can be done at practically zero financial cost, but with tremendous indirect value and show of good will.

The most important free thing is open and visible cooperation with the open source customers. Retweet a project that is using
a Lattice FPGA. "Like" some tweets where @latticesemi is mentioned.

Marketing tweets are typically... well, not very interesting. They are ads. We are flooded and overwhelmed with ads. 
There are nearly 7,000 twitter followers but hardly more than a few likes per @latticesemi ~~ad~~ tweet. 

Engagement tweets are much more interesting. Congratulating some student that won an award with a project using a Lattice product:
Now that's cool. Tweet a picture of a lab, or staff. Post some code samples in a blog. 

There was a [part 1 blog](https://twitter.com/latticesemi/status/1216914336796553216?s=20) back in January. It started out great... 
but then. Nothing. No code samples. No getting started. Not even a "where to go next". 

Perhaps a Lattice Engineer could show up on discord once in awhile? Or here's an exciting idea: how about hosting a 
Lattice AMA (ask me anything)! Do something like that, for an hour or two - say, every quarter or so. Hear first hand what
your customers have to say. Engage in dialog. Find out what they want.

## Benefits

This is what it is all about, right? What is the _benefit_ to Lattice Semiconductor?

Education and reach. Why not have Lattice chips be the _de facto standard_ in all university and other educational environments? 
Why let some other company step into this role? Schools don't want expensive, proprietary tools. 

If there's a comfort zone for students with a particular technology, of course they will likely stick with that technology in
their next project and with their next employer.

That's how the [ULX3S](https://radiona.org/ulx3s/) got started; The Lattice FPGA is used by over 330 University Students
_every year_. Now there's a new company formed after a successful Crowd Supply campaign to get this board into the hands of
more people all over the world. The more boards they sell, the more FPGA chips that Lattice sells. The more people that 
like using lattice chips, the more people that will be more likely to use that same technology in their own project. 

One of the comments I received when putting together these notes:

> my fear is that they'll go all for "we see no commercial importance""

There's "commercial importance" beyond the quarterly report and balance sheet.

By embracing the open source community, Lattice benefits by having a worldwide enthusiastic team promoting their products. 
Dollars cannot buy that kind of marketing value.
